# unbound-bible-archive
Archive for bibles once offered for free on https://unbound.biola.edu

This is a backup (of sorts) of the bibles that were freely available on https://unbound.biola.edu/index.cfm?method=downloads.showDownloadMain that has been discontinued

Most of these were from my own archive that I used for testing Praisenter.  The rest were downloaded from https://www.biblesupersearch.com/unbound-downloads/

I do not endorse any of these bibles to be accurate and cannot verify their content.
